        <h2 class="section-title">Technology Challenges Are Slowing Scientific Progress</h2>
        <p>
          As a research leader or principal investigator you have one primary responsibility. Deliver rigorous scientific results 
          that lead to new understanding, new treatments, new publications, and new impact. Yet today you also must manage data systems, 
          compliance requirements, research infrastructure, and a complex landscape of tools and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          In modern research environments data comes from many directions. You collect clinical measures, laboratory assay results, 
          sequencing or omics data, imaging and text data from collaborators. These sources require workflows, pipelines, secure storage, 
          reproducible analysis, and governance rules that laboratories were not originally designed to handle.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many research teams these challenges create a hidden tax on productivity. Valuable time is spent troubleshooting infrastructure 
          or reconciling data formats. Manual processes are required to move data between systems or ensure compliance. These burdens create bottlenecks 
          at every stage of your research program and slow the pace at which you can convert data into insight.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not a problem of willpower or willingness to innovate. It is a structural challenge at the intersection of 
          science, technology, and operational demands. Addressing it requires clear technical leadership and systems that match the complexity 
          of the research goals you lead.

        <h2 class="section-title">Who This Work Supports</h2>
        <p>
          I focus on supporting research leaders who carry responsibility for science and the systems that make sound science possible. 
          That includes the technology you rely on each day to collect, store, analyze, and share results.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Principal Investigators and lab directors responsible for complex, multi-source data</li>
          <li>Clinical and translational research teams with evolving protocols and data pipelines</li>
          <li>Labs operating under grant funding constraints and compliance requirements</li>
          <li>Rare disease research programs such as lipodystrophy or metabolic disorders</li>
          <li>Collaborative research groups needing stable infrastructure for growth</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If your research involves data infrastructure, analytics workflows, regulatory compliance, or scaling your digital systems 
          to match scientific ambition, this work is intended for you.

        <h2 class="section-title">Why Strategic Technical Leadership Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Solving infrastructure challenges is not about adding tools. It is about guiding your technology decisions in a way that consistently 
          supports your scientific priorities. Research technology is not static. It needs adaptation, governance, and alignment with the goals 
          you pursue each day.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Fractional CTO combines technical expertise with strategic clarity so your team can focus on what matters most. 
          You get executive-level leadership without the overhead of a full-time hire. 
          This gives your lab or research program a partner who can anticipate challenges and help you move forward with confidence.
